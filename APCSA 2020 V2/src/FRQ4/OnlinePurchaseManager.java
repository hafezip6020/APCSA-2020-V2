/*Part C

OPEN-ENDED SECTION

A programmer would like to add a method getCheapestGizmoByMaker, 
which returns the least expensive Gizmo purchased by an individual 
from a given maker.

Write a description of how you would change the Gizmo and OnlinePurchaseManager 
classes in order to support this modification. 
 
Make sure to include the following in your response. 

•	Write the method header for the getCheapestGizmoByMaker method. 
	DO write code for this part.

•	Identify any new or modified variables, constants, constructors, 
   or methods aside from the getCheapestGizmoByMaker method. 
   DO NOT write code for this part.
   
•	Describe, for each new or revised variable, constant, constructor, 
   or method, how it would change or be implemented, including visibility and type. 
   You do not need to describe the getCheapestGizmoByMaker method.
   DO NOT write code for this part.
   
   Add price of Gizmo when creating the object
   Create a method that organizes the Gizmos by price and the return index zero
